      <h3>Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters</h3>
      <p class="history">
        After graduating Oxford University, being drafted in the Korean War, and
        battling the Shadow King in Cairo, Egypt, Xavier decided to devote his
        life to protecting humanity from evil mutants and safeguarding innocent
        mutants from human oppression, believing that both could peacefully
        coexist. Xavier worked with fellow mutation expert, Dr. Karl Lykos, as
        well as Dr. Moira MacTaggert, and they began discussing the idea of
        founding a school for mutants. Before recruiting his first students, a
        mysterious man calling himself "Cable" arrived at the mansion. In
        exchange for teaching him about the present, Cable aided Xavier in
        equipping the mansion with advanced technology.
      </p>
      <h3>X-Men and New Mutants</h3>
      <p class="history">
        More mutants moved into and out of the mansion as the X-Men family grew.
        The first time the mansion was destroyed, it was during a battle with
        the Sidri. While the mansion was being rebuilt, the X-Men briefly
        relocated to an island in the Bermuda Triangle once used by Magneto.
        When the mansion was rebuilt, it with upgraded with Shi'ar technology.
        The X-Mansion served as the site for several special occasions,
        including the marriage of Cyclops and Madelyne Pryor,[18] the birth of
        their son, Nathan Summers in the kitchen, and later the marriage of
        Cyclops and Jean Grey. Eventually a whole new team of New Mutants was
        enrolled. When Xavier was near-fatally wounded and sent into space to
        recover with the Shi'ar, he left the care of the school to Magneto. The
        mansion was later destroyed again, this time by Mr. Sinister. With the
        mansion left in ruins, the X-Men relocated to Cooterman's Creek in
        Australia, X-Factor remained in the X-Factor Complex in New York City,
        and the New Mutants briefly resided on X-Factor's ship before moving
        into the subterranean levels under the ruins of the mansion under the
        leadership of Cable.
      </p>
      <h3>Upgrade</h3>
      <p class="history">
        Only after Professor X's return from space, and the reuniting of the
        X-Men was the mansion rebuilt. To upgrade the mansion's technology,
        Professor X asked Forge. The upgrades included fitting the Danger Room
        with hard-light holographic technology, constructing a hangar for a new
        Blackbird, update Cerebro's software. A war room was also added to the
        subterranean levels. While installing the upgrades, the Danger Room
        spoke to Professor X and asked, “Where am I?”. Realizing that the Danger
        Room had mutated and become sentient, but still needing to train his
        X-Men, Professor Xavier made the choice to ignore and hide the lifeform.
        After being attacked by Sentinels, the villain White Queen was left in a
        coma and cared for in the medical bay.
      </p>
      <h3>Going Public</h3>
      <p class="history">
        Under the influence of Cassandra Nova, Professor Xavier publicly outed
        himself as a mutant. After this revelation, the Xavier Institute once
        again opened its doors to students, this time with a greatly increased
        enrollment. To house the new students, an X-shaped dormitory was built
        behind the mansion. Because Cerebro gained a nanotech body and was
        eventually destroyed, Professor X and Beast created Cerebra to serve as
        their new mutant tracking, telepathic computer. The school continued to
        face challenges from outside, such as protesters and the fanatic cult,
        the U-Men, but they also faced challenges from within, such as a
        possessed Professor X, a student-led riot, and Xorn forming a new
        Brotherhood of students and destroying the mansion. Prior to its
        destruction, Professor X decided that at the end of the term he would
        step down as Headmaster and pass the reins onto Jean Grey.
        Unfortunately, Jean died in the confrontation with Xorn.
